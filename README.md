# Snake-Game

Do you remember snake game in Nokia Cellphones? Then you are in my age! lol...

During my learning python, I had a project to create a snake game in python. I have the file ready to use. you can enjoy the game!

You will need the following pyhton base libraries:
- turtle
- random

I created this project with Python 3.10.6 version interpretor and in Visual Studio Code. If you had any issue, please make sure you are using the same version of python.
